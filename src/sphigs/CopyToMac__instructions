		INFORMATION FOR THOSE COPYING FROM UNIX TO MAC

The files which should be transferred to a Mac in order to create the Mac
version of SPHIGS lie in three directories:
	1) src/sphigs
	2) examples
	2) examples/viewing_demo.MAConly

In each of those directories, you'll find a file called
"__mactransfer_filelist", naming all the files in that directory that should be
sent to the Mac.  This file will help you automate the transfer if you know
some basic UNIX/shell tricks.  For instance, if you will use ftp to do the
transfer, you can use the following sed command to create a file containing a
"put" command for each file:

	sed 's/^/put /' __mactransfer_filelist  > /tmp/putcmds
	
The resulting file may be fed straight into ftp's stdin, being prepended with a
carriage return (so the first "put" won't be ignored) and appended with a
"quit". 

The file containing SPHIGS's resources (SPHIGSproject.rsrc.hqx) is in hex
format and (as soon as you've gotten it onto a Mac) it must be converted to
binary via the BinHex program, or the StuffIt program, or any equivalent
supporting BinHex format.

Now...  on the Macintosh...


You must first install SRGP as directed in that source hierarchy's
release notes.

Next, in the root folder that you labeled "SRGP_SPHIGS", create a new folder called "SPHIGSExamples".  Place the resource file here, and all files
transferred from the "examples/" directory.  You will create project
files here later.

Also in the root folder, make another folder called "MacSPHIGS".  It
should contain the ".c" and ".h" files found in the "src/sphigs/"
directory.

In the folder called "SRGPincludes" that you created in the THINK C folder tree,
add the following header files:

	sphigs.h	mat3.h
	sphigslocal.h	elementType.h
	sph_face.h

Follow the directions in "MacSPHIGS_README" to compile SPHIGS.
