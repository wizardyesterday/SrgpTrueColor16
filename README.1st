This is a port of SRGP so that runs on X when in 16-bit display mode.  I
reworked srgp_color_X.c and srgp_echo_X.c to index into my global
colorPallette[] array so that proper color color setting could be achieved.
I could have gutted the whole system, but I really wanted to keep things in
the spirit of SRGP such that pseudocolor is used in a truecolor environment.
It's not perfect, but it works.  I was more interested in seeing the
wonderful SRGP algorithms in action.

Note that I have forced things to work with a 16-bit display.  This may break
the MAC-centric code.  I think it should be okay since conditional compiles
are performed.
